      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Maruhiti Tea Shop, a place where tradition and taste come
        together in every cup. Located in the heart of Kathmandu, we are a
        family-run tea shop that has been serving the finest and most flavorful
        teas for years. Our journey began with a passion for tea and a vision to
        create a warm, inviting space where everyone can experience the joy of
        sipping on high-quality, locally sourced tea.<br />
        At Maruhiti चिया पसल, we believe that a cup of tea is more than just a
        drink—it's an experience. Whether you're enjoying a rich, aromatic
        masala tea or a light, refreshing herbal blend, we take pride in
        offering a wide variety of teas to suit every palate.<br />
        Our menu also includes an assortment of traditional snacks and light
        bites, all carefully selected to complement your tea and enhance your
        experience with us. <br />What sets us apart is our commitment to
        quality. We work closely with local tea farmers to source the freshest
        and most flavorful leaves, ensuring that every cup served is made with
        the utmost care and attention to detail. Our tea is brewed to
        perfection, offering a harmonious balance of flavors that transport you
        to a world of relaxation and comfort.<br />
        Beyond just tea, we aim to create a community space where friends,
        families, and tea enthusiasts can gather, unwind, and share good times.
        The cozy ambiance of our tea shop, combined with the warm hospitality of
        our staff, makes Maruhiti चिया पसल a special place to visit time and
        time again. We invite you to step into our tea shop, take a seat, and
        enjoy a cup of tea that will delight your senses and leave you coming
